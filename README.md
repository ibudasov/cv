# Igor Budasov's CV

## Summary	
I really like working on strategical and structural improvements, which perfectly fits my personality type — INTJ. Being high in conscientiousness and dominance (DISC), gives me ability to work in teams and independently, concentrating on deep work and long-term vision. Pretty good at conflicting, negotiating and communicating, as a part of teamwork.
However, my personality type is not well suited for the management roles, multitasking and fighting local fires.
